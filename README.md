# battle-for-bitcoin
Pokemon battle system for game design practice using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Ongoing project)

This is forked from https://github.com/DeusMalsith/pokemon-battle-system. I have turned this into an educational game to teach about Bitcoin opcodes.

How to play
-------------------

Click the start button to begin the game.

The opcode critter will test your knowledge before you can capture it. If you're not well-versed, you'll surely lose.

Your goal is to prove your knowledge, and wear down the opcode critter. Once worn down, you can capture the critter.

It's up to you, after capturing the opcode critter, whether to implement it or not. You decide, based on your new knowledge, whether the opcode should be dead or alive.

TIP: If your attacks are too weak, you may need to brush up on some alpha!

Goal of the game
-------------------
The goal of the game is to defeat/capture the opcode critters. Once captured, you can decide for yourself whether they should be DEAD or ALIVE
